# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
df_test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# JSab and Michael Campos provided very detailed analysis on the time data.
# 
# Here I would like to share my method, and I think it confirms their conclusion that the unit of the time is minute in this dataset.
# 
# The method I used to figure out the time definition is through Fourier transform.
# Compute the histogram of the event time

# we can look into the frequency structure of the histogram
